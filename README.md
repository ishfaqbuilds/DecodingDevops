### ⚡ DecodingDevOps

I don't know Linux yet. I'm learning it properly: file systems, permissions, how systems actually work, before I touch Kubernetes or cloud. This repo is proof of that journey. No titles I haven't earned. No claims I can't back up. Just real progress, documented.

I believe that *"Works on my machine" is not a valid shipping strategy.*
